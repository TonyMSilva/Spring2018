Hello 2017 Club Members!

This is the depot we will be using to upload, merge, branch and distribute our code. 

Guide to how to use GitHub is here: https://youtu.be/whxkyix1Q9s 

Tools needed:

Visual Studio: https://beta.visualstudio.com/downloads/ Or use MonoDevelop.
(MonoDevelop is good from those who use Apple, because it comes with Unity (below))

Unity: https://unity3d.com/unity
